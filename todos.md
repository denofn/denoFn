- Put registry back to linked volume -> you want to mount to external volume on cloud (Digitalocean f.e.)
  - put this path in a variable loaded by shell script
- consolidate shell scripts into 1
  - ingest volume path to registry
  - MAYBE remove + create docker volume to registry `docker volume create ...`
  - OTHERWISE just map the path in docker-compose
  - docker-compose up -d
- docker-compose
  - add registry volume
- registry
  - move away from potentially allowing workers all deno permissions and refactor it to a network whitelist
- execution
  - ingest permissions for network whitelist and pass to orchestration
- extract orchestration layer to separate module
  - try toAsyncIterator for spawning deno processes
  - spawning and killing shouldn't exist "inside" execution layer
  - potentially extract into separate dockerfile as well
- move to monorepo and ingest deps per package (and ingest own deps from jsdeliver/deno.land/...)
  - maybe run publish script that rewrites deps per package
